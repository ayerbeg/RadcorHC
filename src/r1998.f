! Three models are used, each model has three free parameters.  The

! contrived.  Each model fits the data very well, and the average of

! used to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to model dependence.

!     DR = is the total uncertainty in R, DR = sqrt(D12+D22+D32). 670
!          DR is my best estimate of how well we have measured R.  At   
!          high Q2, where R is small, DR is typically larger than R.  If
!          you have faith in QCD, then, since R1990 = Rqcd at high Q2,  
!          you might wish to assume DR = 0 at very high Q2.

! NOTE:    In many applications, for example the extraction of F2 from  
!          measured cross section, you do not want the full error in R  
!          given by DR.  Rather, you will want to use only the D1 and D2
!          contributions, and the D3 contribution from radiative        
!          corrections propogates complexely into F2.  For more informa-
